# Decision Tree Classifier for Kyphosis Prediction

This project implements a Decision Tree classifier to predict the presence or absence of Kyphosis (a spinal condition) based on patient characteristics.

## Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and exploring the Kyphosis dataset
- Preparing data for machine learning
- Training a Decision Tree classifier
- Evaluating model performance

## Dataset

The dataset contains 81 observations with 4 features:
- `Kyphosis`: Target variable (present/absent)
- `Age`: Patient's age in months
- `Number`: Number of vertebrae involved
- `Start`: Starting vertebra number

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
